SNES - Bitmap Exporter/Importer is a C# program written by Mike (RainbowSprinklez). This was inspired by a lua script by Alex Corley (H4v0c21). It’s designed to make editing SNES palettes easy. After opening a ROM, the program has the ability to convert 256 bytes or 128 SNES colors to 24 bit RGB and export the data as a 16(*20 for ease of viewing) x 8(*20 for ease of viewing) bitmap file. Each set of 400 pixels in the bitmap file represents 1 SNES color. This file can be opened in an image editor of your choice. Please note that the only image editor tested was “Gimp” but this should work in any image editor that can export .bmp files. This tool was designed for 256 byte level palettes in DKC 1 but will work with other DKC Games. If you have any issues, requests, or questions please reach out to me at Rainbow#2405 on discord or mikemingrone@gmail.com for email.

This also works with objects. There are 15 color palettes per object. This *might* be DKC1 + 2 + 3 exclusive. In this case, a smaller palette is exported.
